## A Very Special Playground for a Very Special Child. 
## Using: Violent Theremin | https://github.com/mdn/violent-theremin

### This page uses a gorgeous example of the Web Audio API shown on Mozilla Developer Network Page | Using the Web Audio API
#### https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Using_Web_Audio_API

##### Mozilla's gorgeous example "application developed specifically to demonstrate the Web Audio API is the Violent Theremin, a simple web application that allows you to change pitch and volume by moving your mouse pointer.".   I've done none of the code here, I simply put it up for a child with autism.
